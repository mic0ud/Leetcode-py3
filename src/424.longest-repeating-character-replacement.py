# Testcase Example:  '"ABAB"\n2'
#
# Given a string sÂ that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can
# perform at most k operations on that string.
# 
# In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to
# any other uppercase English character.
# 
# Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters
# you can get after performing the above operations.
# 
# Note:
# Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.
# 
# Example 1:

# Input:
# s = "ABAB", k = 2
# 
# Output:
# 4
# 
# Explanation:
# Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# s = "AABABBA", k = 1
# 
# Output:
# 4
# 
# Explanation:
# Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
# The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
