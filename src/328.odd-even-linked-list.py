#
# Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even
# nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the
# value in the nodes.
# 
# You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space
# complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
# Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
# Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it
# was in the input.
# The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        o, e, evenHead = head, head.next, head.next
        while o.next and e.next:
            o.next = e.next
            if o.next:
                o = o.next
                e.next = o.next
                if e.next:
                    e = e.next
        o.next = evenHead
        return head
