#
# Given an array nums sorted in ascending order, return true if and only if you
# can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists
# of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.
 
# Example 1:
 
# Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
# 1, 2, 3
# 3, 4, 5

# Example 2:

# Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# 3, 4, 5

# Example 3:
 
# Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
# Output: False

# Constraints:
 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10000
