# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes
# in the tree.
# 
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
# is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
# 
# Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant
# of itself according to the LCA definition.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# All of the nodes' values will be unique.
# p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parents = []

        if root.val == p.val or root.val == q.val:
            return root

        self.search(root, p.val)
        for node in reversed(self.parents):
            if self.search(node, q.val) and self.search(node, p.val):
