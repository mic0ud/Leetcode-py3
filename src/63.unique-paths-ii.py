#
# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in
# the diagram below).
# 
# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
# is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in
# the diagram below).
# 
# Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths
# would there be?
# 
# 
# 
# An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
# 
# Note: m and n will be at most 100.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [
# [0,0,0],
# [0,1,0],
# [0,0,0]
# ]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
# There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
# 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
# 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
#
