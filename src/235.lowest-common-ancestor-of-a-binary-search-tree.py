#
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
# two given nodes in the BST.
# 
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
# is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
# 
# Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant
# of itself according to the LCA definition.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# All of the nodes' values will be unique.
# p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
#

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
