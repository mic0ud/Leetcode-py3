# Testcase Example:  '[0,1,2,3,4,3,4]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25
# representing the letters 'a' to 'z': a value of 0 represents 'a', a value of
# 1 represents 'b', and so on.
# 
# Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree
# and ends at the root.
# 
# (As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller:
# for example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".Â  A leaf of a node
# is a node that has no children.)

# Example 1:

# Input: [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
# Output: "dba"

# Example 2:
 
# Input: [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]
# Output: "adz"
 
# Example 3:

# Input: [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]
# Output: "abc"

# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 8500.
# Each node in the tree will have a value between 0 and 25.
