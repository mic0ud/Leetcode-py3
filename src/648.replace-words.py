# Testcase Example:  '["cat","bat","rat"]\n"the cattle was rattled by the battery"'
#
# In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some
# other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For
# example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word
# another.
# 
# Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to
# replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a
# successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the
# shortest length.
# 
# You need to output the sentence after the replacement.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: dict = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the
# battery"
# Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The input will only have lower-case letters.
# 1 <= dict.lengthÂ <= 1000
# 1 <= dict[i].length <= 100
# 1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
# 1 <= sentence words length <= 1000
