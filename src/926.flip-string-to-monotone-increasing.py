#
# A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some
# number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly
# 0.)
# 
# We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or
# a '1' to a '0'.
# 
# Return the minimum number of flips to make SÂ monotone increasing.
 
# Example 1:

# Input: "00110"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.

# Example 2:

# Input: "010110"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.

# Example 3:

# Input: "00011000"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.

# Note:
 
# 1 <= S.length <= 20000
# S only consists of '0' and '1' characters.

        '''
        we assume the string after flip is s = '0'*i + '1'*j, the index of first '1' is i

        we just need to find the i in the initial string. We make all 1 before index i flip to 0, and make all 0 after index i flip to 1. 
        Then, we get the right answer.

        for instance, s = 010110.
        if we choose the first 1(index=1) as i, we need to make all 1 before i flip to 0(all 0), make all 0 after i flip to 1(all 2),so the answer is 2.
        if we choose the second 1(index=3) as i, the answer is 1 + 1 = 2
        if we choose the third 1(index=4) as i, the answer is 2 + 1 = 3
        and so on
